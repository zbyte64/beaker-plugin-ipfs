# beaker-plugin-ipfs

Adds the `ipfs:/` protocol to Beaker.

This is a very minimal, experimental plugin.
It was created to demonstrate the basics of an IPFS plugin for Beaker.
It needs more work!

## Installation

To install this plugin

```bash
# assuming you cloned beaker into ~/beaker:
cd ~/beaker/app
npm install beaker-plugin-ipfs
```
